# MLOps-Challenge

Take the model above and do the following:
* Set up a repository for this model in a public github repo
* Serialize this model
* Containerize this model (ie write a Dockerfile that the model can run in)
* Write a minimal unittest in the framework of your choice
* Set up a CI Tool on your repo. Because your repo is public many CI Tools have free licenses for open source software, please use one of those
* Add a test for the accuracy of your model
* Minimal documentation
